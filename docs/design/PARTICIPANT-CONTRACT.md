# Participant-domain wire/server contract — design draft R4

**Status: DRAFT — decisions made by this draft, not yet ratified.** This redraft
parks at the two-key gate: reviewer-of-record plus the liminal domain-owner pass
(Hermes Crumpet). “Decided-by-draft” below means that R4 selects one contract
shape for those keys to accept or refute; it does not grant implementation
authority before both keys turn.

**Author:** Vesper Lynd. **Drafter:** Sol worker.

## 0. Provenance, authority, and laws

### 0.1 Provenance

This draft is pinned to liminal commit
`ce8814daa748373d8ffc66b3ff1664f1697a5f4e`, confirmed as the merge base of this
design branch. Every repository citation retained from R1–R3 or added in R4 was
opened and re-verified in this checkout against that pin. A bare `path:line`
below therefore means that path and current line at that named commit; no
citation is inherited from an outline or review.

R1 originated from SDK-receive dispatch blocked-upstream, norn session
`256a81a0`, envelope `claude-dev-sdk-receive.8rss9K`. That worker reached the
transport-versus-participant-domain gap, stopped at the brief's valve, and
produced the evidence base retained here. That session remains the **RESUME
VEHICLE** once this contract lands.

R2 is the redraft required by second-key refusal tear `22923c37`, read from the
newest `claude-review-contract-tear.*` envelope. The delta outline decides the
five blockers. Where the tear classified a matter as a decision but the outline
expressly leaves it to an owner or evidence gate, the outline governs and the
tension is recorded in §0.3 and §7 rather than silently erased.

R3 is the targeted redraft required by the second key's refusal ruling of
2026-07-13 and full tear envelope `b1623e31`. That key confirmed that all five
R1 blockers are resolved in R2; they and §0.3 survive. R3 decides only the new
first-attach, compaction, membership, lifecycle-observer, concurrent-holder,
and citation surfaces. Where the tear offered alternatives or suggested a
possible owner gate, the governing R3 outline selects one candidate contract;
those tensions are recorded item by item in §0.4.

R4 is the composition redraft required by second-key refusal tear `5de60e4c`,
read from envelope `claude-review-contract-r3.RMX45H`. The ruling confirms all
six R2 refusal items are resolved in form and mandates decisions—not new
mechanisms—at seven seams among receipts, Leave, observer projection, compaction,
and retention. R4 makes those decisions in place and records them in §0.4.

The corrected boundary survives R1: the server side has symmetric **transport**,
not a participant-domain contract. At the pin, transport parks on readiness,
has bounded inbox configuration with an installed READY notifier, and owns
correlated push-reply slots
(`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:193-212`,
`crates/liminal-server/src/config/types.rs:226-236`,
`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/apply.rs:378-405`,
`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/supervisor.rs:224-240`). Those
surfaces do not jointly specify participant identity, participant cursor
authority, replay, or participant lifecycle verdicts: Push carries correlation
and opaque bytes, while Deliver has only a per-subscription sequence
(`crates/liminal/src/protocol/frame.rs:381-405`,
`crates/liminal/src/protocol/frame.rs:429-444`).

### 0.2 Binding laws

**LAW 1 — NO-POLLING (Tom, 2026-07-13 01:16Z, design constant).** No
application-layer poll loops anywhere in the product. Crash detection stays
event-driven: linked-EXIT in-VM, connection-fate cross-process. The heartbeat
option for no-FIN liveness is dead. The no-FIN bound is designed **inside**
event-driven machinery, not around it. If a design has a timer whose job is
“check whether something changed,” it is wrong: redesign it to be **TOLD**.
This law binds §§2-7, especially §3.

**LAW 2 — BELIEVED STATE IS NOT CITABLE STATE (tear-side law).** Every sentence
asserting the state of the liminal codebase must cite a verified file and line
at the named commit above, or must be a named socket in §7. This law binds the
whole document.

**LAW 3 — TWO-KEY GATE.** Nothing here is ratified until the reviewer key and
Hermes Crumpet's liminal domain-owner key both pass it. “Decided-by-draft” and
“requires” describe the candidate contract presented to those keys, never
implementation authority.

**Silence attack / provenance acceptance.** A reviewer refutes this section by
finding any repository-state sentence without a pinned citation, any citation
that does not support its sentence at the pin, or wording that mistakes a draft
decision for two-key ratification.

### 0.3 R1 → R2 changelog

Driver: second-key refusal tear `22923c37` and its full envelope findings.

| Refusal item | R2 change | Where |
|---|---|---|
| B1 — impossible zero-duplicate application delivery | Rewrote R-C3 in place to **at-least-once delivery, exactly-once marking**; exposed `(conversation_id, delivery_seq)` as the application idempotency key and made crash-window redelivery an acceptance case. | §4 R-C3 and its acceptance frame |
| B2 — unauthorized cursor construction | Closed `«PARTICIPANT-ID-ORIGIN»` by draft decision: the server mints an unforgeable attach secret, returns it exactly once, and authorizes cursor access before attach. | §4 R-C1; §7 |
| B3 — incoherent global sequence/cursor/recipient state | Made v1 conversations broadcast domains, made sequence allocation and record admission one commit, and closed lifecycle recipients. Targeted delivery is excluded. | §4 R-C2–R-C4; §5 R-D1; §6–§7 |
| B4 — lifecycle authority on the wrong trait | Kept `ConnectionNotifier` byte-untouched, introduced participant-domain `ParticipantLifecycle`, and separated worker-registration rollback from participant finalization. **R-A3's trait-widening recommendation is withdrawn.** | §2, especially R-A3 |
| B5 — SIGSTOP cannot be detected by TCP keepalive | Split host/network death from wedged-process liveness. SIGSTOP now must produce no false `ConnectionLost`; cursor stall is the only layer-local observable. | §3 R-B1–R-B5 and acceptance |
| M1 — existing listener violates LAW 1 | Named the current nonblocking-accept/sleep/reap loop and made its retirement a prerequisite of the server-side build. | §1 |
| M2 — protocol-1.0 exclusion was prose only | Required negotiated capability state, close on failed negotiation, and one grep-able outbound participant-frame construction/enforcement choke point. | §5 R-D2 |
| M3 — sockets were decisions in disguise | Audited every R1 socket, decided identity, ack shape, retention units, mux, and recipients, and added a `decided-by-draft / genuinely-open` column. **Recorded outline/tear tension:** the tear sought owner choices for no-FIN defaults and the legacy-resume migration now; the governing outline leaves `«NO-FIN-KERNEL-BOUND»` and `«RESUME-COMMENT-SERVER-MISMATCH»` genuinely open to platform evidence and owner ruling. | §7 |
| M4/minor — keepalive citation overreach | Removed the claim that the read span itself proves HUP and write errors; R-B1 now cites read EOF/error and outbound write failure separately and describes HUP as readiness confirmed by read outcome. | §3 R-B1 |

### 0.4 R3 → R4 changelog

Driver: second-key refusal tear `5de60e4c`, envelope
`claude-review-contract-r3.RMX45H`.

| Refusal item | R4 decision | Where |
|---|---|---|
| B1 — receipts versus terminal Leave | Leave atomically terminalizes every attach receipt. Later enrollment or credential receipt replay returns typed `Retired`, never a live secret/result. **R3 tension:** byte-identical replay is narrowed to a live receipt epoch; terminal retirement governs afterward. | §4 R-C0/R-C2; acceptance 12 |
| B2 — irreversible Leave lacks authority/idempotency/race order | Leave requires the current capability generation, secret, and authoritative incarnation; carries a write-ahead token; serializes with attach; returns one stable duplicate result; and has explicit attach-wins/Leave-wins outcomes. The wire gains the missing Leave request. | §4 R-C0/R-C2; §5 R-D1; acceptance 13 |
| B3 — observer projection can be compacted away | Chose the tear's **observer-progress retention claimant** alternative. Compaction never overtakes it; admission fails before doing so, and observer progress wakes admission without polling. **Alternative not chosen:** no second outbox or queue is introduced. | §2 R-A4; §4 R-C4; acceptance |
| M1 — duplicate attach succeeds while replacement connection is unbound | Receipt recovery and binding are distinct typed outcomes. A different connection receives `UnboundReceipt`; the SDK persists it, then performs a fresh tokenized attach before exposing replay/ack authority. **R3 tension:** response content remains stable, but “byte-identical success” is withdrawn across connections because it was ambiguous. | §4 R-C0/R-C1; §5 R-D1; acceptance 14 |
| M2 — receipt freshness and unbounded lifetime | Added monotonic `capability_generation`, crash-safe SDK persistence ordering, negotiated signed receipt age/count caps, typed stale-proof/expired-receipt outcomes, and deadline-event GC. No expiry sweep or timer asks whether state changed. | §4 R-C0/R-C1; §5 R-D1; §7; acceptance 15 |
| M3 — marker swallows retained entitled payload | Chose **explicit authorized abandonment through the watermark**. R-C3's promise is narrowed to continuous history, marker fields are renamed `abandoned_after`/`abandoned_through`, and the example says retained 20–29 are deliberately abandoned only on marker ack. | §4 R-C3–R-C5; §5 R-D1; acceptance 6 |
| M4 — retention claim has no floor formula | Defined one monotonic physical-floor formula combining soft member cursors, hard observer progress, and both hard caps; specified atomic prefix removal, cap-overtake markers, last-claim Leave, and multiple-claim/at-cap/below-cap/cursor-0 examples. | §4 R-C4; acceptance 16 |

## 1. The verified gap

The evidence base was re-verified rather than copied:

| Claim | Verified evidence at `ce8814d…` | Contract consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Worker unregistration has neither participant identity nor cause. | `ConnectionNotifier` is explicitly a connection-keyed worker-registration hook and `on_worker_unregistered` carries only `pid` (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/notifier.rs:1-25`, `crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/notifier.rs:46-52`). | Participant lifecycle needs its own keyed abstraction; §2 does not widen this trait. |
| A notifier unregistration call is also used for rollback while the connection remains open. | If application registration succeeds but registry storage fails, `worker_register_response` calls `on_worker_unregistered(pid)` as compensation and returns a rejection (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/apply.rs:205-213`). | That path must produce no participant event and cannot be assigned a fake close cause. |
| In-VM participant liveness is deliberate event doctrine. | The conversation resource says participant crash arrives through a trapped linked-EXIT notifier, “never by polling, sleeping, or a heartbeat,” and its waiter parks on that event (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/conversation.rs:3-7`, `crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/conversation.rs:43-49`). | §3 stays inside linked-EXIT, readiness, and connection-fate events. |
| TCP transport resume is refused, while its comment claims re-Subscribe replay. | `TcpRemoteTransport::resume` returns `SdkError::Protocol`, and its comment says re-issued Subscribe triggers durable replay (`crates/liminal-sdk/src/remote/tcp/mod.rs:190-207`). | The migration mismatch remains a named owner ruling; participant resume cannot reuse that claim silently. |
| The existing SDK recovery model is subscription-local and in memory. | `ResumeRequest` carries `subscription_id` and client-held `from_sequence`; `SubscriptionRecovery` stores acknowledgements in a `BTreeMap`/`Vec` and clears them on unsubscribe (`crates/liminal-sdk/src/connection/recovery.rs:33-58`, `crates/liminal-sdk/src/connection/recovery.rs:154-158`). | Participant recovery needs distinct participant/conversation types or an explicit legacy API migration. |
| Current server Subscribe accepts no cursor and unsubscribe resets delivery sequencing. | Subscribe takes stream/channel/schema inputs and constructs a new subscription; unsubscribe removes both delivery counter and held frame (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/apply.rs:349-421`, `crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/apply.rs:432-443`). | R-C2/R-C3 define a different durable domain and starting convention. |
| Push has no participant envelope; Deliver's sequence is narrower. | Push is `{ flags, stream_id, correlation_id, payload }` with opaque payload; Deliver documents `delivery_seq` as per-subscription, starting at 1 (`crates/liminal/src/protocol/frame.rs:381-405`, `crates/liminal/src/protocol/frame.rs:429-444`). | §5 adds participant frame types without repurposing either key. |
| Authentication cannot by itself authorize a participant cursor. | Server auth is one shared bearer token and expressly “not an ACL system” (`crates/liminal-server/src/config/types.rs:25-31`). | R-C1 adds a participant-scoped capability while leaving connection auth intact. |
| Current negotiation is not an outbound capability boundary. | Connection state records `authenticated` but no selected protocol/capability (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/state.rs:18-59`). `connect_response` sets authenticated before negotiation and answers negotiation failure without closing (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/apply.rs:281-295`). | R-D2 makes negotiation state and the outbound choke point structural. |
| The current listener already has the banned polling shape. | The listener defines sleep backoffs, loops over a nonblocking `accept`, polls shutdown, reaps crashed processes, and sleeps on `WouldBlock` (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/listener.rs:11-12`, `crates/liminal-server/src/server/listener.rs:125-147`). | The server-side build for this contract must retire that loop in favor of readiness/blocking notification plus explicit shutdown and process-exit wakes. Compliance cannot be claimed before then. |
| Existing caps have a signed configuration pattern. | `LimitsConfig` defines named hard caps and defaults, rejects zero by field name, and constructs explicit defaults (`crates/liminal-server/src/config/types.rs:193-203`, `crates/liminal-server/src/config/types.rs:257-316`). | Keepalive, retention, and receipt lifetime/count extend this pattern rather than creating silent unlimited states. |

**`«RESUME-COMMENT-SERVER-MISMATCH»` is broader than a comment edit.** The
legacy public model is subscription-keyed and client-cursored, while R-C1/R-C3
are participant/conversation-keyed and server-cursored. §7 requires an owner to
choose distinct protocols or a versioned deprecation/removal; merely correcting
the comment cannot close the socket.

**LAW-1 prerequisite.** The participant implementation may not inherit the
listener loop above. Accept readiness, shutdown, and process exit must each wake
their owner through blocking/readiness/event notification. No periodic reap,
sleep-backoff change detector, or “temporary” polling adapter is conforming.

**Silence attack / gap acceptance.** Refute this section by identifying an
existing frame that jointly carries participant identity, conversation identity,
a durable authorized cursor, replay position, and lifecycle verdict, or by
showing server Subscribe consumes such a cursor. A nearby field with narrower
scope does not close the gap. Conversely, finding the named listener loop does
not refute R4; it proves the explicit retirement prerequisite remains unmet.

## 2. Section (a) — participant lifecycle at the participant boundary

### Proposed contract

**R-A1 — Typed cause, participant-domain owner.** Introduce `CloseCause` (final
name subject to domain-owner review) and a separate participant-domain observer,
working name `ParticipantLifecycle`. Its domain facts identify
`(participant_id, conversation_id, connection_incarnation)`; each committed
lifecycle record and observer callback also carries its canonical delivery key
`(conversation_id, delivery_seq)`:

- `Attached { participant_id, conversation_id, connection_incarnation }`;
- `Detached { ..., cause: CloseCause }` for an explicit detach, clean
  Disconnect, authorized superseding attach, or server-directed shutdown;
- `Died { ..., cause: CloseCause }` for connection or process failure; and
- `Left { participant_id, conversation_id }` for R-C2's explicit, durable,
  terminal membership transition, never for transient detach or connection loss.

`CloseCause` has at least these non-collapsible classes:

- `CleanDeregister`: explicit participant detach or clean protocol Disconnect.
  The current dispatcher classifies Disconnect as Close
  (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/apply.rs:46-53`), and the process
  then follows the normal finish path
  (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:280-289`).
- `ConnectionLost`: TCP EOF/FIN without domain detach, kernel keepalive expiry,
  or fatal read/write failure. EOF and read error are distinct paths
  (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:238-269`), and fatal
  outbound drain errors tear the connection down
  (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:169-182`).
- `ProcessKilled`: trapped linked-EXIT or a locally known supervisor
  termination. Conversation actors already expose the trapped EXIT event
  (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/conversation.rs:173-186`), but
  the external reap path cannot recover beamr's private exit reason
  (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/supervisor.rs:1643-1658`), so
  `«EXTERNAL-EXIT-REASON»` still blocks complete fidelity.
- `ProtocolError`: decode or protocol-state refusal that terminates the
  connection. Decode refusal is distinct in the buffer path
  (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:695-710`).
- `Superseded`: an attach authorized by the same participant capability replaces
  an older incarnation under R-C1. It is an explicit participant-domain action,
  not evidence that the old transport died.
- `ServerShutdown`: the server deliberately ends an active participant binding
  during shutdown. It is not misreported as participant choice or transport
  failure.

The enum may carry typed detail, but no catch-all may erase these classes. EOF is
not proof of clean deregistration. An `Attached` event has no invented close
cause; terminal `Detached` and `Died` binding events do. `Left` is the typed
terminal membership fact and needs no fabricated close cause.

**R-A2 — Event mapping and one finalization authority.** Cause assignment occurs
where the authoritative event is received. The conversation log is the **sole
durable lifecycle authority**: the participant owner commits exactly one
terminal lifecycle record per active participant binding. Projection to an
observer is governed by R-A4 and is not a second exactly-once effect promise:

| Source event | Participant-domain result |
|---|---|
| Successful R-C1 attach commit | One `Attached` record; a failed/rolled-back attach commits none. |
| Explicit participant detach | `Detached(CleanDeregister)` for that binding; membership and cursor remain durable. |
| Explicit participant Leave | One ordered `Left` is both the active binding's terminal record and the terminal membership record; R-C2 retires the participant id, receipts, cursor, and retention claim atomically. |
| Clean protocol Disconnect | `Detached(CleanDeregister)` for every binding still active on that connection. |
| Authorized replacement by a newer incarnation | `Detached(Superseded)` for the old binding, then `Attached` for the new binding in conversation order. |
| TCP FIN/EOF, confirmed read error, fatal write error, or kernel keepalive expiry | `Died(ConnectionLost)` for every active binding on the connection. |
| Trapped linked-EXIT or locally known forced process termination | `Died(ProcessKilled)`; external reason detail remains gated by `«EXTERNAL-EXIT-REASON»`. |
| Terminating decode/protocol-state refusal | `Died(ProtocolError)`. |
| Server shutdown | `Detached(ServerShutdown)` unless the participant completes explicit detach first; shutdown is neither participant choice nor inferred transport death. |
| Worker-registration compensation in `crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/apply.rs:205-213` | **No participant event.** The registration never became a participant binding. |

The connection owner publishes one typed connection-termination event to the
participant owner; the participant owner derives the keyed terminal events. It
does not infer cause from later absence and adds no detector, sweep, or timer.

**R-A3 — R1 recommendation explicitly withdrawn.** `ConnectionNotifier` remains
byte-for-byte API-compatible: do not widen `on_worker_unregistered(pid)`, do not
add participant or cause semantics to it, and do not use its compile failures as
a lifecycle inventory. It remains the worker-routing callback its source
specifies (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/notifier.rs:20-52`).
`ParticipantLifecycle` is the only participant lifecycle delivery vehicle.

**R-A4 — Broadcast lifecycle records; honest observer projection.** Each
successful attach and each terminal participant event commits the corresponding
lifecycle record through R-C2. The record is the domain fact. `ParticipantLifecycle`
projects committed records **at least once with exactly-once marking**, keyed by
`(conversation_id, delivery_seq)`: it durably marks projection progress, may
redeliver after a crash, and never changes the key. The callback receives that
key and the same incarnation as the wire record. Applications requiring an
exactly-once observer effect must durably deduplicate or transactionally commit
against the key, exactly as under R-C3.

Each conversation stores a durable cumulative `observer_progress` initialized to
`0`. The projector examines records in sequence, advances across non-lifecycle
records without a callback, and advances across a lifecycle record only after
its at-least-once projection is durably marked. `observer_progress` is R-C4's
**hard retention claimant**: no compaction commit may remove a sequence above it.
If satisfying either retention cap would require that removal, the candidate log
admission is atomically refused with typed `ObserverBackpressure`, consumes no
sequence, and waits for a later caller retry; observer-progress persistence emits
the wake that makes new admission possible. There is no outbox, hidden queue,
poll, sweep, or periodic retry. Thus an arbitrarily long observer outage remains
bounded by the existing log caps: the log fills, admissions refuse, the lifecycle
fact remains reconstructible, and observer recovery resumes projection.

### Silence-attacking acceptance frame

Exercise successful attach, explicit detach, explicit Leave, clean Disconnect,
EOF, read error, write error, kernel expiry, protocol error, linked-EXIT, local
force-close, authorized supersession, external termination, and server shutdown.
Assert exactly one correctly classified ordered lifecycle record for each
participant-domain finalization. Crash after record commit but before observer
notification: after recovery the event is observed at least once, and every
copy has the same `(conversation_id, delivery_seq)`. Crash after callback but
before projection-progress persistence: assert duplicate observation with that
same key and a dedupe-able single effect. Stop observers for two conversations,
admit until both byte and entry caps would be exceeded, and prove further commits
receive typed `ObserverBackpressure` without sequence consumption while every
unprojected lifecycle record remains retained. Recover one observer: its own
progress event permits only its conversation to admit again, with all pending
callbacks delivered at least once; no timer or sweep participates. Separately
force the worker-registration storage rollback at
`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/apply.rs:205-213`; assert the
worker compensation callback runs while **zero** participant events or records
are produced. A reviewer refutes this section by finding a fake cause on
rollback, an active binding with no terminal record, two terminal records for
one binding, a redelivery with a changed key, an exactly-once observer-effect
promise, or participant authority routed through `ConnectionNotifier`.

## 3. Section (b) — connection fate, with honest liveness classes

### Constraint first

**NO-POLLING:** no application-layer poll loops anywhere in the product. Crash
detection remains event-driven—linked-EXIT in-VM, connection-fate
cross-process. No heartbeat frame, periodic sweep, scan, synthetic liveness
write, or timer whose job is to ask whether state changed.

R4 retains two different liveness classes:

1. **Class 1 — host/network/TCP-path death.** Host down, network partition or
   black hole, socket close, FIN/EOF, and fatal socket errors are connection-fate
   failures. Kernel machinery may bound silent no-FIN detection.
2. **Class 2 — wedged process with a live TCP stack.** SIGSTOP, deadlock, and
   livelock are **excluded from connection-fate detection by design**. A live
   kernel may continue acknowledging TCP probes while userspace does nothing;
   this layer must not manufacture a death verdict.

### Proposed contract

**R-B1 — Kernel connection fate, Class 1 only.** Enable `SO_KEEPALIVE` on every
participant TCP socket and configure per-socket idle, probe interval, and probe
count. The kernel owns probe scheduling; userspace parks on the existing
readiness path (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:193-212`).
Read EOF/error is confirmed on the read path
(`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:238-269`); fatal write
outcomes come from the outbound writer
(`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/outbound.rs:174-235`) and tear down
through the process drain path
(`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:169-182`). HUP is not
claimed as an independent branch in those spans: readiness must be confirmed by
EOF or error. This corrects R1's citation overreach.

**R-B2 — Owned, certifying socket adapter.** Add a direct production `socket2`
dependency with the explicitly required feature set; the current server lists
`socket2` only under dev-dependencies
(`crates/liminal-server/Cargo.toml:11-36`), though the workspace declares 0.6
(`Cargo.toml:38-46`). One owned adapter configures accepted sockets before
connection-process spawn; current production setup only calls
`set_nonblocking(true)` there
(`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/supervisor.rs:744-765`). The
adapter must:

- validate nonzero idle seconds, interval seconds, and probe count against the
  target's range and granularity;
- set `SO_KEEPALIVE` plus all three target options exactly once;
- read back enablement and all three effective values; and
- refuse participant mode at startup or accept when exact certification is
  unavailable—never round, truncate, or silently fall back.

The fields extend the named/defaulted/nonzero `LimitsConfig` pattern verified in
§1. Exact signed defaults, platform mappings, and macOS/Linux worst-case formula
remain the genuine evidence socket `«NO-FIN-KERNEL-BOUND»` together with
`«KEEPALIVE-PORTABILITY»`; R4 does not manufacture numbers.

**R-B3 — Honest Class-1 bound.** The advertised detection bound is the supported
platform's documented worst case for the read-back configuration, including
option granularity and retry semantics. A black-holed peer is not promised
detection before that machinery expires; an independently authoritative EOF or
socket error may report earlier. Unsupported or uncertifiable platforms refuse
participant mode.

**R-B4 — Ordinary writes are additional events, never probes.** An application
send may surface connection failure immediately; the outbound writer treats a
zero write or unrecoverable error as fatal
(`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/outbound.rs:219-235`). The server
must not generate a send merely to test liveness.

**R-B5 — Class-2 truth is cursor stall, not death.** A wedged participant stops
acking, so its R-C3 cursor freezes and retention pressure accrues. If compaction
overtakes it, `HistoryCompacted` on eventual return is the truthful record. This
layer emits no `ConnectionLost`, no wall-clock liveness score, and no synthetic
probe for SIGSTOP/deadlock/livelock. Eviction, alerting, or other wedged-process
semantics belong to the layer above under `«WEDGED-PARTICIPANT-POLICY»`.

**R-B6 — Listener prerequisite is part of LAW-1 acceptance.** The listener's
current accept/sleep/reap loop named in §1 must be replaced by blocking or
readiness-driven accept, an explicit shutdown wake, and process-exit
notification. Retention, replay, and lifecycle paths may not add polling under a
different name.

### Explicit non-goals

- No application heartbeat frames, heartbeat sweeper, or synthetic liveness send.
- No periodic accept, reap, replay, cursor, or lifecycle scan.
- No wall-clock liveness score.
- No connection-fate claim for a wedged process with a responsive TCP stack.

### Silence-attacking acceptance frame

With certifiable test values, inject a Class-1 black hole/host-loss fault and
assert `ConnectionLost` no later than the documented kernel worst-case bound
plus scheduler/test tolerance; an authoritative earlier socket failure may win.
Then SIGSTOP a participant while its host and socket remain live: assert **no
`ConnectionLost`, no death lifecycle record, and no forced cursor advance**.
Resume it and observe either normal continuation or the same participant's
`HistoryCompacted` outcome if retention passed it. Inventory the listener and
all participant threads, timers, tasks, and writes: none may periodically ask
whether state changed. The false-positive assertion for Class 2 is as
load-bearing as Class-1 detection.

## 4. Section (c) — authorized registration and server-backed cursor/replay

### Proposed contract

**R-C0 — Write-ahead idempotent participant transactions and bounded receipts.**
Every enrollment attach, credential-bearing attach, and Leave carries a
client-generated, unguessable, single-purpose attempt token. The SDK **must
durably persist the token before sending the request** and re-present that same
token after response loss or a crash. Attach keys are
`(conversation_id, enrollment_token)` before mint and
`(conversation_id, participant_id, attach_attempt_token)` thereafter; Leave
uses `(conversation_id, participant_id, leave_attempt_token)`. All serialize on
the same participant state. A duplicate commits no second capability, binding,
lifecycle record, rotation, cursor transition, or retention claim.

Every attach receipt contains `{ participant_id, capability_generation,
attach_secret, originating_connection_incarnation, receipt_expires_at }` and has
an explicit state:

- while its generation is current and its origin binding is authoritative, replay
  on that same connection returns the original typed `Bound` result;
- replay on any other connection returns typed `UnboundReceipt` with the same
  credential payload and **does not** bind that connection;
- after a newer generation completes/forgets the receipt, replay returns typed
  `ReceiptExpired { reason: Superseded, receipt_generation,
  current_generation }` and returns no secret;
- after R-C2 Leave commits, every enrollment and attach receipt for the participant
  returns typed `Retired` and returns no secret; and
- after the live receipt deadline, replay returns typed
  `ReceiptExpired { reason: Deadline, ... }` and returns no secret.

Thus byte identity applies only to a live receipt's credential payload, never to
connection-binding status or across the terminal/expiry state transitions. The
participant record permanently retains the one enrollment-token fingerprint, so
an expired or retired enrollment token can never mint a ghost. Credential retry
requests carry `participant_id` and the presented generation; their expected
result generation is its checked successor (enrollment expects `1`). If current
generation equals that expected result but no live token entry remains, replay is
`ReceiptExpired { reason: Deadline }`; if current generation is greater, it is
`ReceiptExpired { reason: Superseded }`; a participant tombstone makes it
`Retired`. The server therefore returns the exact typed state after the
secret-bearing body is gone without retaining every historical secret or token.

Receipt cost is signed and known before send. Add nonzero
`attach_receipt_ttl_ms`, server-wide `max_pending_attach_receipts`, and
`max_pending_attach_receipts_per_participant`, each with a signed default and
advertised in negotiated participant capability state; they extend the verified
named/defaulted/nonzero `LimitsConfig` pattern
(`crates/liminal-server/src/config/types.rs:193-203`,
`crates/liminal-server/src/config/types.rs:257-316`). Receipt-cap exhaustion
refuses the candidate attach before commit. A receipt becomes non-live at the
earliest of: a later authorized mutation proves its returned generation/secret,
Leave terminalizes it, or its commit-derived deadline expires. GC removes the
secret-bearing body at that boundary. Expiry uses one admitted durable deadline
event (and a request-time deadline check), never a periodic sweep or timer that
asks whether state changed.

**R-C1 — Retry-safe enrollment, generation-ordered rotation, and binding.** Every
successful attach returns a newly minted secret: enrollment creates generation
`1`; every credential-bearing success checked-increments the monotonic
`capability_generation` and rotates the secret. Generation exhaustion is a typed
terminal refusal with no commit. Connection authentication remains the shared
bearer gate, not an ACL. Participant cursor authority is separate:

1. Enrollment carries mandatory `{ conversation_id, enrollment_token }`. There is
   no credential-free bare frame. One commit mints `participant_id`, generation
   `1`, and `attach_secret`; creates R-C2 membership at cursor `0`; binds the
   originating connection; records `Attached`; stores the enrollment fingerprint
   and live receipt; and returns typed `Bound` with that generation and secret.
   Distinct enrollment tokens create distinct participants; collision retries
   before publication and never aliases identity, sequence, or cursor state.
2. Enrollment or attach receipt replay follows R-C0. In particular, recovery on
   a replacement connection is never reported as attached: it returns
   `UnboundReceipt`. The SDK first atomically persists its non-stale generation
   and secret, then sends a **new** credential-bearing attach with a fresh
   write-ahead token. Only that new `Bound` result enables replay or ack authority
   on the replacement connection.
3. A credential-bearing attach presents `{ participant_id,
   capability_generation, attach_secret, attach_attempt_token }`. The server
   rechecks generation and secret at the serialized commit point before reading,
   replaying, advancing, or rebinding the cursor. Success increments generation,
   invalidates the presented secret, returns a fresh secret, and—if an
   incarnation is active—records exactly one ordered
   `Detached(Superseded)`/`Attached` handoff and fences the old incarnation.
4. Lost rotation response is recovered with the invalidated old secret and same
   token only while its receipt is live. R-C0 returns `Bound` on the still-current
   origin connection or `UnboundReceipt` elsewhere, with no second rotation or
   handoff. After completion/expiry it returns the typed non-secret outcome, never
   treats the old secret as a new attach credential.
5. The SDK persists results in this crash order: compare the received generation
   with the durable one; reject a lower generation as stale; require identical
   secret for an equal generation; for a greater generation atomically persist
   `{ participant_id, generation, secret, receipt_expires_at }` **before** marking
   the attempt complete or exposing binding/replay/ack authority. A crash at any
   point replays the write-ahead token. A delayed generation can never overwrite
   a newer secret.
6. A stale generation/secret with a new token is a terminal connection-level
   refusal with no cursor side effect, lifecycle record, broadcast, or retention
   pressure. In a two-holder race, the first serialized valid attach rotates;
   the second is stale. The log contains at most one Superseded/Attached pair per
   genuine handoff.
7. Cursor and replay authority key on the verified current-generation capability,
   authoritative connection binding, and `conversation_id`, never on a receipt
   or the shared bearer token alone.

This is a participant-scoped continuity capability, **not an ACL system**. The
shared token gates the connection; the current generation and attach secret gate
identity continuity and that participant's cursor. Mapping humans, agents, or
external principals belongs above. If ids later originate externally, the
server still mints the generation/secret; an external id cannot authorize a
cursor. The remaining total-loss/operator re-issue state is named in
`«ATTACH-SECRET-LIFECYCLE»`.

**Domain-owner refutation target.** Hermes may prefer bearer-latest-wins
simplicity over rotation, but that is a different contract: equal holders can
then generate unbounded broadcast handoff traffic and retention pressure. A
ruling for that alternative must add an explicit event-driven admission/rate
bound, accept and specify the denial-of-service consequence, and replace the
rotation and no-record acceptance cases below; it may not silently delete the
fence or introduce a polling limiter.

**R-C2 — One atomic, gap-free conversation log.** The server is the sole writer
of a strictly increasing `delivery_seq` for each conversation. Admission,
retention, and sequence allocation are one commit: a single admitted fact appends
one record at the next number; R-C1's supersession transaction reserves and
atomically appends its two contiguous ordered facts. Any failure appends nothing
and consumes no number. Sequence exhaustion is a typed terminal refusal, never
wraparound. The current
pump's narrower counter is assigned before enqueue and held with its frame to
preserve order (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/delivery.rs:114-142`);
that implementation fact is not reused as the durable transaction.

A conversation is a **broadcast domain in v1**, with durable membership distinct
from transient attachment:

1. **Membership begins at mint and survives detach.** R-C1's enrollment commit
   makes the participant a conversation member. Attachment is only the
   connection-scoped binding. Any number of detaches, disconnects, deaths, or
   server restarts leave membership, cursor, and retention claim intact.
2. **Initial cursor is `0`.** A newly minted member has acknowledged nothing and
   is entitled from sequence `1`, including history committed before mint. Every
   **member** is entitled to every committed record of the conversation;
   entitlement is membership-scoped and is never attachment-filtered. If the
   retention floor has already passed sequence `1`, the late member's first
   delivery is R-C4's covering `HistoryCompacted` marker and its explicit-accept
   path, by composition of these two rules—not an undefined starting point.
3. **Offline records remain entitled.** Records committed while a member is
   detached are replayed in order on reattach by R-C5's existing
   `(cursor, watermark]` mechanism. The mechanism already supplied the replay;
   this rule supplies the previously missing entitlement.
4. **Leave is terminal and is not detach.** The v1 authority is deliberately
   narrow: only the currently authoritative bound incarnation may send
   `LeaveRequest { participant_id, capability_generation, attach_secret,
   leave_attempt_token }`. Shared connection authentication and stale
   incarnations are insufficient; v1 defines no operator-initiated Leave. The SDK
   write-aheads the token under R-C0, and the server rechecks incarnation,
   generation, and secret at the same serialized participant-state linearization
   point used by attach.
5. **One Leave commit retires everything.** It appends one ordered R-A1 `Left`
   record, terminalizes the active binding and membership, invalidates the current
   secret, converts every outstanding enrollment/attach receipt to R-C0
   `Retired`, releases the member cursor/soft retention claim, and permanently
   tombstones `participant_id` in one commit. The tombstone retains the enrollment
   fingerprint and successful Leave token/result but no attach secret. Tombstone
   lookup precedes live capability validation: duplicate Leave with that token
   returns the stable `LeaveCommitted { retired_generation, left_delivery_seq }`
   and commits no second record even though the secret is now invalid; any other
   later attach/Leave returns `Retired` with no record.
6. **Attach/Leave races have one order.** If attach linearizes first, it rotates
   generation and incarnation; the competing old-incarnation Leave fails typed
   `StaleAuthority` with no record. If Leave linearizes first, the participant and
   all receipts are terminal; the competing attach returns `Retired` with no
   binding or record. There is no state in which a stale binding retires the new
   holder. Detach merely ends an attachment; membership, cursor, and its R-B5
   cursor-stall/retention pressure persist.

Records include application payloads, attach, detach, death with R-A1 cause,
Leave, and `HistoryCompacted`. Every member's entitled subsequence is therefore
the full per-conversation sequence, so cumulative gap checking has no legitimate
non-recipient gap. Targeted or filtered delivery inside a conversation is
excluded from v1 under `«TARGETED-DELIVERY»`, not left as a semantics hole.

**R-C3 — At-least-once continuous delivery or explicit abandonment; exactly-once
marking.** The server stores one durable cumulative cursor per authorized
`(conversation_id, participant_id)`. While `cursor + 1 >= physical_floor`, it
offers every entitled retained `(conversation_id, delivery_seq)` at least once
until cumulatively acknowledged; transport loss or reconnect may offer the same
pair again. If `cursor + 1 < physical_floor`, continuous history is impossible:
the server offers R-C4's explicit abandonment marker instead of promising the
retained suffix. This is the deliberate R4 narrowing of R3's unconditional
retained-record offer.

The ack shape remains explicit:

`ParticipantAck { conversation_id, through_seq }`.

For continuous history, the server accepts it only from the currently authorized
incarnation and only when every sequence from cursor + 1 through `through_seq`
was made available contiguously. For broken history, delivery of
`HistoryCompacted { abandoned_after, abandoned_through, ... }` authorizes exactly
one alternative: acking the marker's own `delivery_seq` explicitly abandons the
entire named interval—including any records still physically retained at or
above the old floor—and atomically advances the cursor to the marker sequence.
Those payloads are not asserted or marked as delivered; the marker records the
client's authorized relinquishment of delivery.

The server records marker delivery to the current incarnation before accepting
that ack and refuses an ack spanning abandonment without it. Until the client
accepts, the cursor holds, no suffix payload flows, and R-B5's cursor-stall
observable remains. The server persists the new cursor before confirmation.
Re-acknowledging the current cursor is an idempotent confirmed no-op; an
uncovered skip or regression is refused. Each cursor transition is marked once
even if confirmation is retried.

The SDK keeps an in-session confirmed-contiguous watermark. It suppresses a
redelivery only when it can prove `delivery_seq <= watermark`. It hands the
canonical idempotency key `(conversation_id, delivery_seq)` to the application.
After a crash between an application effect and durable ack persistence, the
same record is redelivered with the same key. **Exactly-once application effect
is not promised.** Applications that require it must durably deduplicate or
transactionally commit their effect against that key.

**R-C4 — Monotonic physical floor, soft members, hard observer, and honest
abandonment.** Retention has both
`max_retained_conversation_bytes` and
`max_retained_conversation_entries`, each nonzero with a signed default. Bytes
bound payload/storage and entries bound metadata. The fields extend the verified
`LimitsConfig` pattern
(`crates/liminal-server/src/config/types.rs:193-203`,
`crates/liminal-server/src/config/types.rs:257-316`).

The physical floor is reproducible. Let `H'` be the high watermark after a
candidate record append; `F` the current first physically retained sequence
(`H + 1` when empty); `m` the minimum durable member cursor after membership
changes in that transaction, or `H'` when there are no members; and `o` the
conversation's R-A4 `observer_progress`. Define:

- `preferred_floor = min(m, o) + 1` (checked arithmetic);
- `cap_floor` as the smallest floor at or above `F` whose retained suffix,
  including the candidate record, satisfies **both** hard caps; and
- `F' = max(F, preferred_floor, cap_floor)`.

A successful log commit appends at `H'`, sets the physical floor to `F'`, and
atomically removes exactly the old prefix `[F, F')`. The floor never decreases.
A single record too large for either cap is refused before sequence allocation.
Member claims are **soft**: `cap_floor` may exceed `m + 1`, and each member with
`cursor + 1 < F'` is overtaken and receives the marker path below. Observer
progress is **hard**: `cap_floor` may not exceed `o + 1`. If satisfying a cap
would cross that boundary, the whole candidate admission returns
`ObserverBackpressure`, removes nothing, and consumes no sequence. Persisted
observer progress recomputes the formula and emits the admission wake; no sweep
or poll does so.

A broken-history marker is a sequenced
`HistoryCompacted { affected_participant_id, abandoned_after,
abandoned_through, physical_floor_at_decision }`. `abandoned_after` is the held
cursor and `abandoned_through` is the pre-marker watermark; the next sequence is
the marker itself. These names deliberately distinguish physical compaction from
client-authorized abandonment. With cursor `10`, physical floor `20`, and
watermark `29`, marker `30` offers abandonment of `11..29`: records `11..19` are
physically gone, while retained entitled records `20..29` are explicitly
included in the offer. If the client accepts marker `30`, none of `20..29` is
delivered and the cursor becomes `30` by authorized abandonment. If it declines,
the cursor remains `10`, no `20..29` payload is released out of order, and the
stall remains visible. This is not a claim that `20..29` was compacted or seen.

The marker is offered at least once under its canonical key. Delivery loss,
ack-confirmation loss, or reattach redelivers the same retained marker. If the
floor later removes an unaccepted marker, a new marker may cover from the still-
held cursor through the new pre-marker watermark. Live commits serialize after
the marker and remain queued until acceptance; no timer retries it.

Worked floor cases (assume the byte cap is not tighter than the stated entry
cap):

1. **Multiple claims.** At `H=100`, `F=1`, member cursors `{10, 40}`, and
   `o=100`, the preferred floor is `11`. If the caps require `cap_floor=25`, one
   commit removes `1..24`, sets `F'=25`, overtakes only cursor `10`, and leaves
   cursor `40` continuous.
2. **Below-cap Leave.** From `F=11`, cursors `{10, 40}`, and `o=100`, Leave by
   cursor `40` appends `Left` but leaves the preferred floor `11`; Leave by cursor
   `10` instead leaves cursor `40` as minimum and advances the floor to `41`.
3. **At-cap final Leave.** At `H=100` with one cursor-`0` member and `o=100`, the
   Leave commit appends `Left` at `101`, removes the released member claim, deletes
   the old retained prefix through `100`, and sets `F'=101`, retaining `Left` for
   the observer. When the observer marks `101`, the empty-log floor becomes `102`.
4. **Cursor-0 late member at cap.** Mint never lowers `F`. If mint appends
   `Attached` at `101` while `F=25`, the new cursor `0` is immediately overtaken;
   its first replay outcome is a marker offering abandonment `1..101`. Cap
   eviction may advance `F` further but may not cross `observer_progress + 1`.
   If the unprojected `Attached` blocks marker admission, the marker receives
   typed `ObserverBackpressure` until observer progress emits the retry wake;
   enrollment is never silently rolled back or polled.

**R-C5 — Replay/live cutover and multi-conversation mux.** At attach, the server
establishes a sequencer watermark and subscribes the binding to later committed
records without a race. Normally it emits retained `(cursor, watermark]` in
order, then hands off once to live records `> watermark`. If `cursor + 1` is
below the physical floor—including cursor `0` for a late member—R-C4's
abandonment marker is (re)delivered instead. Its explicit ack abandons through
the marker's pre-commit watermark; only records sequenced after the marker then
flow. Live commits arriving during ordinary replay or marker acceptance are
queued under the same admission bounds and wake the
connection by an event, never a scan. The current READY marker runs one full
slice and the quiet connection parks after a final probe
(`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:648-658`,
`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:193-212`). The exact
linearization mechanism remains `«REPLAY-LIVE-CUTOVER»`.

One connection may attach many conversations. Participant frames are demuxed by
`conversation_id`; their v1 `stream_id` is fixed to zero and carries no identity,
ordering, cursor, or correlation meaning. Per-conversation replay and ack
streams may interleave on the connection but each conversation's sequence order
must be preserved. Connection teardown finalizes every active binding through
R-A2.

### Silence-attacking acceptance frame

1. Deliver N, let the SDK confirm its contiguous watermark, duplicate N on the
   same session, and prove the guard suppresses the duplicate it can prove.
2. Apply N in the application, crash before ack persistence, reattach, and prove
   N is redelivered **with the identical `(conversation_id, delivery_seq)`**.
   The test expects this residual; it does not hide it behind “exactly once.”
3. Commit/abort every admission failure point and prove successful records are
   gap-free while failed admissions consume no sequence.
4. Attach three participants, commit payload and lifecycle records, and prove
   all three observe the same sequence. No recipient-filter branch exists in v1.
5. Race a live commit against replay's final retained record; prove no loss,
   duplicate marking, or reordering across the handoff.
6. Put cursor `10` below physical floor `20` at watermark `29`; marker `30`
   must name `abandoned_after=10`, `abandoned_through=29`, and floor `20`.
   Prove `20..29` are still physically retained before the choice. Accept marker
   `30`: prove none of `20..29` is delivered, the client explicitly records their
   abandonment, cursor becomes `30`, and later live records flow. Decline it:
   prove cursor remains `10` and `20..29` is not released out of order. Lose
   marker/ack confirmation and prove same-key redelivery with one cursor advance;
   ack `30` without marker delivery is refused. Repeat across compaction and live
   commit races.
7. Attach two conversations to one connection, interleave their records, and
   prove demux by `conversation_id` with independent cumulative cursors.
8. Hold the system silent; replay advances only on attach, storage completion,
   ack, committed-record, observer-progress, and admitted deadline events—never
   because a timer or sweep checks for work.
9. Commit enrollment and lose its response; retry on the origin connection and
   prove the same generation/credential payload returns with exactly one
   `Attached` record and no ghost. Distinct enrollment tokens create distinct
   participants. Replay after receipt expiry and prove typed `ReceiptExpired`
   cannot mint another participant.
10. Mint a member after N records and prove replay from `1`, or marker-first R-C4
    abandonment if the floor passed it. Detach at a cursor, commit offline
    records, reattach, and prove ordered replay. Leave and prove the formula's
    floor transition, retired id, and no-record refusal.
11. Race two holders of generation G with distinct write-ahead tokens: exactly
    one produces G+1, the loser is stale, and the log has at most one handoff
    pair. Lose the winner's response and replay its live receipt; prove one
    rotation. Try stale G with a new token; prove zero records, broadcasts,
    cursor changes, or retention claims.
12. Commit enrollment, then Leave before any secret-proving reattach; delayed
    enrollment-token replay returns `Retired` without id/secret and creates no
    record or participant. Separately Leave with a live credential-attach receipt;
    replay `(old_secret, same_token, old_generation)` and prove `Retired`, no
    secret, no binding, and no record.
13. Attempt Leave from the shared bearer alone, a stale incarnation, wrong
    generation, and wrong secret; each is refused with no record. Lose a valid
    Leave response and retry the same write-ahead token; prove one stable
    `LeaveCommitted` and one `Left`. Race valid attach and Leave at the serialized
    state: attach-first makes Leave `StaleAuthority`; Leave-first makes attach and
    all receipt replays `Retired`.
14. Commit attach on C1 and kill C1 before its response. Retry the token on C2:
    assert typed `UnboundReceipt`, persist its higher generation/secret, and
    assert C2 has no replay/ack authority. Send a fresh-token attach from C2,
    obtain `Bound`, then prove C2 replays and acks. No response in this sequence
    may ambiguously claim C2 was bound before the final commit.
15. Delay generation G's response until after G+1 is durably installed; prove the
    SDK rejects G and preserves G+1. Crash before and after atomic generation/
    secret persistence and recover by token replay. Exercise the negotiated
    receipt deadline immediately before and after expiry: before returns the live
    typed receipt; after returns `ReceiptExpired`, the secret body is gone, and
    no periodic expiry scan exists. Exceed the signed receipt-count cap and prove
    pre-commit refusal with no rotation.
16. Execute R-C4's four worked floor cases with byte and entry accounting:
    multiple claims `{10,40}`, below-cap Leave of each claimant, at-cap final
    cursor-0 Leave, and cursor-0 late mint at cap. Assert the exact removed prefix,
    monotonic `F'`, which member is overtaken, observer hard-stop refusal, marker
    fields, and the final empty-log floor after observer progress.

A reviewer refutes R-C0–R-C4 by finding an exactly-once application-effect
claim, changed delivery key, ghost enrollment, `Bound` on an unbound replacement
connection, secret returned after receipt expiry/Leave, stale-generation
overwrite, unauthorized or duplicate-record Leave, cursor mutation before
current binding proof, compaction ack without marker delivery, abandoned payload
called delivered, physical-floor transition that differs from the formula, or
compaction above `observer_progress`. A legitimate non-recipient gap cannot
refute cumulative ack because targeted v1 delivery does not exist.

## 5. Section (d) — participant envelope and structural wire evolution

### Proposed contract

**R-D1 — Typed participant records and transaction outcomes.** Add versioned
participant frame types for:

- enrollment request `{ conversation_id, enrollment_token }` and credential
  attach request `{ conversation_id, participant_id, capability_generation,
  attach_secret, attach_attempt_token }`;
- attach outcomes that echo the attempt token and distinguish
  `Bound`, `UnboundReceipt`, `ReceiptExpired` (deadline or superseded), `Retired`,
  and proof/admission refusal. Secret-bearing outcomes carry `participant_id`,
  `capability_generation`, `attach_secret`, and `receipt_expires_at`; no secret
  enters a broadcast record;
- the missing Leave request `{ conversation_id, participant_id,
  capability_generation, attach_secret, leave_attempt_token }`, plus
  `LeaveCommitted`, `StaleAuthority`, and `Retired` outcomes that echo its token;
- participant delivery carrying `conversation_id`, optional
  `sender_participant_id`, `delivery_seq`, record kind, and opaque payload;
- explicit cumulative `ParticipantAck`; and
- typed compaction/abandonment and other refusal outcomes.

Application records name a sender. Lifecycle records name the affected
participant and incarnation and carry attach/detach/death/Leave plus R-A1 cause.
`HistoryCompacted` names the affected participant, `abandoned_after`,
`abandoned_through`, and `physical_floor_at_decision`; it is an abandonment
offer, not a claim that the whole interval was physically removed. Every
committed record has the R-C2 sequence and is entitled to all members in that
order, whether attached or not. `conversation_id`, not `stream_id`, is the mux
key. From a result alone the SDK can always distinguish credential recovery from
connection authority and order credentials by generation.

**R-D2 — One structural protocol-capability choke point.** Leave Push
byte-for-byte untouched and add participant frame discriminants beside it. Push
is a correlated transport with opaque payload
(`crates/liminal/src/protocol/frame.rs:381-405`), so its correlation lifetime is
not the participant log lifetime.

The server must store successful negotiated protocol/capabilities only after
negotiation succeeds. Failed authentication or version negotiation responds and
closes; it never leaves an application-admitted connection. Protocol 1.0 is the
only currently supported version
(`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/apply.rs:20-21`), and preserving an
unknown discriminant as `Frame::Unknown` is parsing behavior only
(`crates/liminal/src/protocol/codec/known.rs:43-54`).

Outbound enforcement is structural:

1. There is exactly one grep-able server construction site for outbound
   participant frames, adjacent to the outbound emitter.
2. That function requires the connection's unforgeable negotiated participant
   capability, accepts a typed domain record rather than an unrestricted
   `Frame`, constructs the participant discriminant, and enqueues it.
3. The generic outbound enqueue path rejects server-originated participant
   discriminants, so no producer can bypass the construction site with a raw
   `Frame`.
4. Replay, live delivery, lifecycle, compaction, attach responses, and close
   verdicts all call that site. Pre-handshake, auth/version error, force-close,
   and protocol-1.0 paths cannot obtain the capability.

This choke point sits at the common emission boundary: ordinary applied
responses currently reach `OutboundWriter::enqueue_frame` from `process_buffer`
(`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/process.rs:713-730`), delivery also
uses `enqueue_frame` (`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/delivery.rs:128-142`),
and that method is where frames are encoded
(`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/outbound.rs:124-153`). A second
participant-frame constructor or unchecked encode path is a contract failure.

**R-D3 — Correlation remains correlation.** `correlation_id` remains the Push ↔
PushReply key; PushReply echoes it and the server owns the one-shot reply slot
(`crates/liminal/src/protocol/frame.rs:381-405`,
`crates/liminal-server/src/server/connection/supervisor.rs:224-233`). Participant
`delivery_seq` and attach credentials never reuse it. A future participant
application reply needs an explicit relationship rather than overloading either
key.

**R-D4 — Payload opacity.** Payload remains uninterpreted application bytes. The
participant record wraps those bytes; it does not inspect or derive identity,
recipient, ordering, or lifecycle facts from them. That preserves the verified
opacity of Push payload (`crates/liminal/src/protocol/frame.rs:381-394`).

### Silence-attacking acceptance frame

From captured wire bytes alone, an SDK must attribute every participant record
to `(conversation_id, delivery_seq)`, identify sender or affected participant,
distinguish payload from lifecycle, and obtain the canonical idempotency key.
For every attach/Leave exchange it must also recover the echoed attempt token,
capability generation, receipt deadline, and typed binding/terminal status; an
`UnboundReceipt` can never decode as `Bound`. Mixed-version tests exercise every
producer class—attach, Leave, replay, live,
lifecycle, compaction, auth/version refusal, force-close, and pre-handshake—and
prove participant discriminants never reach protocol 1.0. A source-structure
test/grep proves there is exactly one outbound participant-frame construction
site and that generic enqueue refuses those discriminants. Push/PushReply codec
vectors remain byte-identical.

## 6. Interactions and non-goals

### Interactions

**R-I1 — Resume becomes buildable, not silently compatible.** The current TCP
resume method is a typed refusal
(`crates/liminal-sdk/src/remote/tcp/mod.rs:190-207`). R-C0/R-C1/R-C3 and R-D1/R-D2
supply write-ahead attach, authorized cursor, replay, idempotency key, and verdict
facts for a later SDK surface. They do not authorize routing participant recovery
through the legacy subscription-local `ResumeRequest`; `«RESUME-COMMENT-SERVER-MISMATCH»`
must rule distinct protocols versus migration/deprecation first.

**R-I2 — Cally/F-3a gate.** The checked-in receive brief assigns the lane and
parks merge at reviewer-plus-domain-owner keys
(`docs/design/SDK-PARTICIPANT-RECEIVE.md:3-10`,
`docs/design/SDK-PARTICIPANT-RECEIVE.md:35-41`). It requires receive facts
including conversation, sender, payload, and sequence
(`docs/design/SDK-PARTICIPANT-RECEIVE.md:96-110`) and reattach from a server
cursor with typed compaction (`docs/design/SDK-PARTICIPANT-RECEIVE.md:128-136`).
The future version carrying that receive path therefore remains gated on this
contract and its implementation.

`«LIMINAL-SDK-VERSION»` is the unfilled future-release dependency gate. It is
distinct from the brief's filled sequencing gate
`«LIMINAL-BASE-VERSION: 0.2.4»`
(`docs/design/SDK-PARTICIPANT-RECEIVE.md:12-33`).

**R-I3 — Resume vehicle.** After both keys pass and the contract lands, norn
session `256a81a0` / envelope `claude-dev-sdk-receive.8rss9K` is the designated
resume vehicle. Until then it remains blocked upstream.

### Non-goals and explicit exclusions

- No implementation, schedule, or release promise in this document.
- No SDK API/ergonomics design beyond facts the wire must expose.
- No application payload schema.
- No ACL or human/agent identity mapping; that belongs above the participant
  continuity capability.
- No exactly-once application effect guarantee.
- No lifecycle outbox or unbounded secret-bearing receipt store.
- No application heartbeat, poll, sweep, scan, synthetic probe, receipt-expiry
  sweep, observer retry loop, or wall-clock liveness score.
- No connection-fate detection for SIGSTOP/deadlock/livelock.
- No targeted or filtered delivery within a v1 conversation. V1 is broadcast;
  `«TARGETED-DELIVERY»` is a named future protocol design, not a current hole.
- Wire and server semantics only.

### Silence-attacking acceptance frame

A reviewer refutes this section by finding a hidden ACL claim, SDK ergonomics
commitment, exactly-once effect promise, targeted-delivery branch, schedule, or
liveness detector. The receive brief must be implementable from explicit R4
facts, except where §7 names a genuine gate.

## 7. Named sockets and decision register

R4 distinguishes decisions made by the draft from genuine unknowns. A
**decided-by-draft** row has one candidate answer and may change only by explicit
key refusal/revision. A **genuinely-open** row names unavailable platform
evidence, an implementation linearization mechanism, a layer-above policy, or
an owner migration decision. Open rows are not permission for implementations
to choose incompatible semantics silently.

| Socket | Status | R4 answer or reason openness is genuine | Closure/refutation evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `«ATTACH-TRANSACTION»` | **decided-by-draft** | Attach and Leave use mandatory write-ahead tokens and one serialized participant state. Duplicate operations commit nothing; attach replay returns typed `Bound`/`UnboundReceipt`/`ReceiptExpired`/`Retired`, never ambiguous success. | All send/commit/response windows, replacement-connection recovery, and terminal receipt tests. |
| `«RECEIPT-LIFETIME»` | **decided-by-draft** | Monotonic generations plus negotiated signed nonzero receipt TTL/count caps bound secret-bearing receipts. Later proof, Leave, or deadline terminalizes the receipt; expiry GC is a deadline event, not a sweep. | Delayed-generation, crash-order, before/after-deadline, cap-exhaustion, and idle-no-sweep tests. |
| `«PARTICIPANT-ID-ORIGIN»` | **decided-by-draft** | Server mints participant id, generation 1, and initial secret inside tokenized enrollment; later attach proves current generation/secret and atomically increments/rotates before cursor access. External ids never authorize a cursor. | Authorization-before-cursor, collision, enrollment replay, generation ordering, rotation loss, and reconnect tests. |
| `«MEMBERSHIP-BOUNDARY»` | **decided-by-draft** | Membership begins at mint with cursor `0`, survives detach, entitles full history and offline commits, and ends only with authoritative tokenized Leave that retires id, receipts, and soft retention claim. | Late join, offline replay, Leave authority/idempotency/races, and floor-transition tests. |
| `«LEAVE-AUTHORITY»` | **decided-by-draft** | Only the current bound incarnation proving current generation/secret may Leave. Attach and Leave serialize: attach-first makes old Leave stale; Leave-first makes attach/receipts retired. V1 has no operator Leave. | Shared-bearer/stale-proof refusals, duplicate stable result, and both race orders. |
| `«ACK-SHAPE»` | **decided-by-draft** | Explicit cumulative `ParticipantAck { conversation_id, through_seq }`; normal ack requires contiguous delivery. A delivered marker may instead authorize explicit abandonment of its named interval. | Normal gap/regression tests, marker-delivery refusal, and proof abandoned payload is not marked delivered. |
| `«COMPACTION-EXIT»` | **decided-by-draft** | `HistoryCompacted` names `abandoned_after..abandoned_through` and the physical-floor snapshot. Acking it abandons through the pre-marker watermark, including the named retained suffix, and advances to marker sequence. | Retained-suffix choice, marker-loss/redelivery, repeated-cycle, concurrent-live, and post-ack flow tests. |
| `«RETENTION-UNITS»` | **decided-by-draft** | Both bytes and entries, with signed nonzero caps. `F'=max(F,min(min_member_or_H,observer_progress)+1,cap_floor)`; members are soft, observer progress hard, and one commit removes `[F,F')`. | Exact byte/entry accounting, multiple claims, observer stop, cap overtake, and Leave examples. |
| `«MULTI-CONVERSATION-MUX»` | **decided-by-draft** | Yes. One connection carries many conversations, demuxed by `conversation_id`; participant `stream_id = 0` and has no semantic role. | Cross-conversation interleaving and independent-cursor tests. |
| `«LIFECYCLE-VERDICT-RECIPIENTS»` | **decided-by-draft** | Every member is entitled to every lifecycle/compaction record in total order, including while detached, unless it explicitly accepts a named abandonment after compaction broke continuity. | Three-party lifecycle/compaction races, offline replay, and explicit-abandonment tests. |
| `«LIFECYCLE-OBSERVER-DELIVERY»` | **decided-by-draft** | The log is sole authority; per-conversation observer progress is a hard retention claimant. Projection is at-least-once with exactly-once marking; admission refuses before compaction could erase pending lifecycle. No outbox exists. | Both observer crash windows, outage past both caps, independent conversation recovery, stable-key dedupe, and zero-event rollback. |
| `«SUPERSESSION-FENCE»` | **decided-by-draft** | Every credential-bearing successful attach checked-increments generation and rotates the secret; stale proof is a connection-level no-record refusal. | Two-holder generation race, single handoff pair, rotation receipt recovery, and stale-proof zero-record tests. |
| `«RESUME-COMMENT-SERVER-MISMATCH»` | **genuinely-open** | Owner must choose separate legacy subscription recovery versus version/deprecate/delete it for participant attach. Outline governs over the earlier tear's preference to decide now; R4 nevertheless makes “comment-only fix” insufficient. | Owner ruling covering types, cursor owner, starting convention, persistence, release boundary, and removal/compatibility tests. |
| `«EXTERNAL-EXIT-REASON»` | **genuinely-open** | Current external reap cannot read the private beamr exit reason; complete `ProcessKilled` detail needs event/API plumbing, not inference. | Typed event payload or nonblocking termination-reason API; no scan substitute. |
| `«NO-FIN-KERNEL-BOUND»` | **genuinely-open** | Exact signed defaults and macOS/Linux worst-case formulas require platform evidence. The contract shape and refusal policy are decided; numbers are not invented. | Platform documentation, readback, and black-hole fault tests proving lower/worst-case behavior. |
| `«KEEPALIVE-PORTABILITY»` | **genuinely-open** | Supported target option/range/granularity mapping and refusal matrix require target validation. | Per-target set/readback and bounded fault tests; unsupported targets refuse. |
| `«REPLAY-LIVE-CUTOVER»` | **genuinely-open** | External behavior is fixed, but the atomic sequencer/storage/binding linearization mechanism depends on the selected durability backend. | Named linearization point and adversarial attach/replay/live/crash tests. |
| `«ATTACH-SECRET-LIFECYCLE»` | **genuinely-open (narrowed)** | Receipt lifetime is decided and is not credential revocation. The deferred reachable state is total client-side loss of current secret and every live receipt/enrollment recovery path, requiring operator re-issue; post-receipt capability expiry and revocation policy remain open. | Threat model and authorized operator re-issue; atomic capability expiry/revocation preserving generation, Retired, and no-polling rules. |
| `«WEDGED-PARTICIPANT-POLICY»` | **genuinely-open** | Connection-fate exclusion is decided. Alerting/eviction for cursor stall belongs to the layer above and must not feed a false lifecycle verdict back into this layer. | Layer-owner policy demonstrating no polling detector and no false `ConnectionLost`. |
| `«TARGETED-DELIVERY»` | **genuinely-open (future only)** | V1 excludes it. A future version must redesign entitlement, cursor scanning, ack validation, and capability negotiation rather than weakening broadcast implicitly. | New versioned contract and mixed-version/recipient-gap tests; not a v1 implementation gate. |
| `«LIMINAL-SDK-VERSION-GATE-NAME»` | **decided-by-draft (owner-closed)** | Preserve both real gates: filled `«LIMINAL-BASE-VERSION: 0.2.4»` and unfilled future `«LIMINAL-SDK-VERSION»`. | Existing owner reconciliation and exact names in §6. |

**LAW 2 closes the evidence escape hatch:** an unresolved dependency is one of
the grep-able genuinely-open rows or it cannot support a codebase-state claim.
**LAW 1 closes the mechanism escape hatch:** none may be “solved” by a timer,
poll, sweep, scan, heartbeat, listener backoff, periodic reap, or synthetic
write whose job is to ask whether state changed.

### Silence-attacking acceptance frame

Search the document for `«` and require every result to appear in this register
or be one of the two SDK gate names explained here. For decided rows, search for
one normative answer in §§2-6. For genuinely-open rows, require the named owner
or evidence and refuse implementation where the gap is load-bearing. Search all
timers, wakes, loops, and tasks—including the listener—and prove each is driven
by admitted work, kernel connection fate, explicit shutdown/process exit, or an
existing domain event rather than change detection.

**Gate posture:** DESIGN DRAFT R4. The five R1 blockers and all six R2 refusal
items remain resolved in form; R4 closes the seven R3 composition findings by
explicit decisions without adding a second durability mechanism. The socket
register separates decisions from real unknowns. Reviewer key plus Hermes
Crumpet's liminal domain-owner key are still required; until both turn, this
document is not ratified and grants no implementation authority.
